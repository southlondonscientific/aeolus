# Development Process

Aeolus is developed through human-AI collaboration. Dr Ruaraidh Dobson provides architecture, design decisions, domain expertise, and quality control. Claude (Anthropic) assists with code implementation, testing, and documentation.

All code is reviewed and approved by the human maintainer before merging.
